# Homebrew cask for the Remote for OpenCode Mac companion.
#
# Lives here as the source of truth; stamp the version and sha256 after a
# release, then copy the file into the tap repo
# (tjameswilliams/homebrew-tap → Casks/remote-for-opencode.rb), which is what
# `brew install --cask tjameswilliams/tap/remote-for-opencode` reads.
#
# The tap also needs a cask_renames.json at its root mapping the pre-rename
# token — {"opencodego": "remote-for-opencode"} — so day-one installs follow
# `brew upgrade` to the new name instead of orphaning.
#
# auto_updates true tells brew this app updates itself (via Sparkle), so
# `brew upgrade` leaves it alone rather than fighting the in-app updater.

  # exactly this. deploy.sh uploads the versioned dmgs without --delete, so
  # this URL keeps working after later releases.
